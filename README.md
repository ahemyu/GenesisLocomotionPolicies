This repo is to collect all my experiments I am conducting for my Bachelors Thesis which is mainly concerned with training quadruped locomotion policies
with the new Open Source Simulator [Genesis](https://genesis-embodied-ai.github.io/)

Some of the tasks include: Performing a Frontflip, Running as fast as possible on Flat ground, navigating rough/uneven terrain.
